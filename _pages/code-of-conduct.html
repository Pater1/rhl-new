      <h4>CODE OF CONDUCT</h4>
      <p>
        Respect gets respect.</br>
        Like most hackerspace and makerspace communities, members generally believe that the purpose of coming together is to learn through doing (aka "do-ocracy") and sharing without judgement or prejudice, and to treat each other with dignity and respect.</br>
        Every participant is responsible for conducting themselves in a manner which encourages others to share and pursue what they love and learn new skills from peers of all ages and backgrounds in a safe and supportive environment.</br>
        Here are a few obvious things that will not be tolerated during our events and activities:</br>
        <ul>
          <li>Sexual harassment</li>
          <li>Hate speech that singles out gender, sexual orientation, faith, or ethnicity</li>
          <li>Physical abuse of any kind, including damage and mistreatment of the facilities</li>
          <li>Attending the event with no effort to participate and or create something (ie, you want to sell or promote something with little or no emphasis on actually making or sharing a skill while you're there)</p>
        </ul>
